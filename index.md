## Where am I?

Have you just realized that whatever you are doing at work is not worth it anymore? Or you've found yourself in a culture that you deeply despise? Or you just think that you suck as a developer and there is no way you can fix it at your current place?

Remember: **you are not alone**.

Ironically, looking for a new job in such circumstances is the most difficult thing to do. Here is where to start.

- Find a way to get your energy back, at least temporarily.
- Think about what you would like to do, or at least what you definitely don't like to do. Write it down.
- Find a friend you can openly talk to, talk to them.
- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
- Create a [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) account.
- Start refreshing your skills. Online platforms like [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com) can help.
- Start [looking for a job](looking-for-a-job.md). It might take a while.

## This site sucks. I can do better.
